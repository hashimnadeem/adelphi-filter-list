# adelphi-filter-list

Hello and welcome!

Here, you will find my code to the Adelphi filter department list exercise. In this exercise, I am tasked to get the data from the API and filter out the elements that have a parent object containing a number. After this, I am to display the resulting array to the screen.

I have added an image of the final results. The image shows the filtered array, showing the elements that have a parent object of null.
